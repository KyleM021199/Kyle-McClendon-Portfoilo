This application is a profolio webpage that has my name presented at the top. Along with that, there is a navigation bar under my name that goes to the about me section,
My work section, and Contact me section. 

### About Me
This section has an image of myself with alt text of "Graduation photo" and a short description related to me below the image.

### My Work
This has where potential applications would be shown off with the title of it on the top and a brief explain of it on the bottom. Also, the first element of the section
is presented larger than the rest of them. Finally, the images have a hover element that makes it become slightly larger and it is <a> linked for future applications.
